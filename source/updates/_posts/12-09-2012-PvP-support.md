As of commit [54e1ae7bf1](https://github.com/SirCmpwn/Craft.Net/commit/54e1ae7bf12aaa089bdec07368e24d82fbf50b95),
you and your friends are able to hop on a Craft.Net server and duke it out! Damage is accurately calculated based
on weapons used. However, armor is not factored into the calculation, mostly because it's impossible to put on
without support for survival-mode inventory management. But don't worry - that's 
[coming](https://github.com/SirCmpwn/Craft.Net/issues/55) in this
[iteration](https://github.com/SirCmpwn/Craft.Net/issues/milestones).
