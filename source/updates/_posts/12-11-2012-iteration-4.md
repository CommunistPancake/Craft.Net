It's that time again, time to announce a new iteration and a new batch of features to add
to Craft.Net. But first, let's take a moment to recap the newly completed iteration, 0.3.
Here's all the stuff iteration 0.3 brought us:

* Minecraft 1.4.4 support
* Player health and hunger management (and food!)
* PvP combat with weapons and armor
* Tile entities - and support for signs
* Survival mode inventory management
* Survival mode mining and item drops (and entity physics)
* Falling sand/gravel/anvils/eggs/etc
* Tool damage and block mining time enforcement
* Player falling damage
* Updated flatland generator to partially support custom flatland

And of course, all the usual performance updates and refactoring of internal code.

Now that all of that is out of the way, let's look onwards to Iteration 0.4! More exciting
things are in store, including:

* Crafting, smelting, enchanting
* Experience
* Farming
* Friendly mobs (with basic AI)
* Paintings, item frames, potted plants
* Sound effects
* Arrows
* Weather

You won't see all of these features immediately, though. The first few weeks of this iteration
is going to be spent refactoring and improving internal code, which has started to get a bit
out of hand. But never fear, all these exciting features will be added quite soon.

And speaking of refactoring, I'd like to request help from the community in doing in-depth code
reviews on Craft.Net to help find performance issues, messy code, and more. Drop me a line if
you'd like to help.
