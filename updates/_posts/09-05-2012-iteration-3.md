With [iteration 0.2](https://github.com/SirCmpwn/Craft.Net/issues?milestone=3&state=closed) being completed
in [8a27ed8](https://github.com/SirCmpwn/Craft.Net/commit/8a27ed8c148ea220ab5d98af98d36f7eeed99e34), it's
time to get a head start on iteration 0.3 - the "survival iteration".  Goals for 0.3 include:

* PvP
* Health and hunger support
* Survival resource management
* Basic server-side entities

This includes things like timing how long it takes to mine a block, or the damage taken from a given sword
against certain kinds of armor. Check out the issues and more details here:
