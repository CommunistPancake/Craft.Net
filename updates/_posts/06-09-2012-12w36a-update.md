title: 12w36a Update
layout: post
---

I pushed a quick update to Craft.Net that adds the following features:

* Skull Blocks & Skull Items
* Carrot on a Stick Item
* Nether Star Item

This should bring us up to speed with [12w36a](http://www.mojang.com/2012/09/minecraft-snapshot-12w36a/).

Note that the Skull code requires tile entities, which aren't implemented at all, so placing them is a
little wonky.

Check it out here: commit [d2237cb](https://github.com/SirCmpwn/Craft.Net/commit/d2237cb97d9720bf95a57364f25c60c5993d3518)
